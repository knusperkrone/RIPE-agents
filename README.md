# RIPE clients

This Repo is for handling the RIPE clients.

Currently the classic ESP32 is supported, which makes basic moisture based watering.

There is also an implementation for the raspberry pi, which has a more powerful toolset.

Each repo provides README how to run/flash and customize the agents.
